## The store-like inventory app.

It's my final PYTHON project after CODE_IN_PLACE course from Stanford University.
Using PICKLE module to store/save the data.

In this final project i've created the store-like inventory:
  - *grocery items*
  - *their prices*
  - *their quantities*
  
This program runs in the terminal.

How to run the app:
  - Clone the code.
  - Open your editor and it's terminal. 
  - Navigate to the file inventory.py
  - type: "py inventory.py" and hit enter.
  
 This app implements all 4 **CRUD operations**;
  - **C** - to create new item in the inventory
  - **R** - to read the data from the inventory
  - **U** - update the quantity of the choses item from the inventory
  - **D** - delete the item, its price and quantity from the inventory
